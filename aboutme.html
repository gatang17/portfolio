                <p class="p_info  ">Hi, I’m Gretel — a passionate graphic and web design student with a background in computer engineering and database administration. I began my professional journey in Cuba, where I worked in IT and later transitioned into photography and creative editing. That experience shaped my problem-solving mindset and sharpened my eye for detail.

                    After moving to the U.S., I decided to pursue formal education in graphic and web design to expand my creative skills and align them with industry standards. Since then, I’ve developed projects in branding, web design, print production, and visual storytelling — blending the precision of a tech background with the vision of a designer.
                    
                    I’m proficient in tools like Adobe Illustrator, InDesign, and Figma, and I also have experience with Excel, SQL, and programming languages like Java and Python. I’m organized, adaptable, and committed to continuous learning. Whether I’m designing a brand identity, building a homepage, or editing a photo, I aim to create work that is clear, purposeful, and human.</p></div>
